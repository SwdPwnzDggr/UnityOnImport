# UnityOnImport
*Allows you to easily create new import settings for specific folders*

**Created in Unity 5.5**

### How to Use
1. Import **OnImport** into your projects editor folder.
2. Open the OnImport window by navigating to Window > OnImport
3. Fill out the script name, make sure this is unique. I recommend [AssetName]Assetsto[FolderName]Folder. e.g. ModelAssetstoModelFolder
4. Fill out the folder name you want to import the assets.
3. Follow the window's instructions and fill it the fields.

### ToDo
- Probably Bugfix
